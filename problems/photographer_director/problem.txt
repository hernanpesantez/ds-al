Note: Chapter 2 is a harder version of this puzzle. The only difference is a larger constraint on N.
A photography set consists of N cells in a row, numbered from 1 to N in order, and can be represented by a string C of length N. Each cell i is one of the following types (indicated by Ci, the ith character of C):
If Ci= “P”, it is allowed to contain a photographer
If Ci= “A”, it is allowed to contain a camera
If Ci= “B”, it is allowed to contain a backdrop
If Ci= “.”, it must be left empty

A photograph consists of a photographer, an actor, and a backdrop, such that each of them is placed in a valid cell, and such that the actor is between the photographer and the backdrop. Such a photograph is considered artistic if the distance between the photographer and the actor is between X and Y cells (inclusive), and the distance between the actor and the backdrop is also between X and Y cells (inclusive). The distance between cells i and j is |i - j|∣i−j∣ (the absolute value of the difference between their indices).
Determine the number of different artistic photographs which could potentially be taken at the set. Two photographs are considered different if they involve a different photographer cell, actor cell, and/or backdrop cell.
Constraints
1 \le N \le 2001≤N≤200
1 \le X \le Y \le N1≤X≤Y≤N
Sample test case #1
N = 5
C = APABA

Expected Return Value = 1
Sample test case #2
N = 5
C = APABA
X = 2
Y = 3
Expected Return Value = 0
Sample test case #3
N = 8
C = .PBAAP.B
X = 1
Y = 3
Expected Return Value = 3
Sample Explanation
In the first case, the absolute distances between photographer/actor and actor/backdrop must be between 11 and 22. The only possible photograph that can be taken is with the 33 middle cells, and it happens to be artistic.
In the second case, the only possible photograph is again taken with the 33 middle cells. However, as the distance requirement is between 22 and 33, it is not possible to take an artistic photograph.
In the third case, there are 44 possible photographs, illustrated as follows:
.P.A...B
.P..A..B
..BA.P..
..B.AP..
All are artistic except the first, where the artist and backdrop exceed the maximum distance of 33.
